**`Computer science and computer engineering student at ISEL`**

I´m software developer in the making. I didn't think I would ever find pleasure in something that is aging me faster. All jokes aside, I really  love making code (testing it... not soo much) and have deep understanding what is happening under the hood (It's not magic for my sadness). I really like to learn new stuff (except data base things, work from the devil I guess), then have a mental breakdown because I don't understand anything, but then starting doing stuff with that new thing I learnt without realizing it.
My public projects until now are the college one's.

 <summary><h3> Coding journey </h3></summary>
 I started my coding journey at college. I did't know anything about coding. I knew it was just a bunch of colorful words that did magic. When I started coding I hated it, I didn't know how to express an idea in code, like how am I suppose to do a game with for, while, if... What really kept me going was the hardware part (what a crazy time that was). After some time, I started to enjoy coding because I begun to understand the basics and started to resolve problems that seemed impossible before.
 For the future I want to learn new languages like C++, Typescript, GO, Scala..., and improve my programming skills in general.
